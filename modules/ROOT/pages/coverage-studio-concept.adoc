Run a coverage report from Anypoint Studio to obtain detailed insights of the effectiveness of MUnit tests on your Mule applications.

The following configurations apply when you execute your MUnit tests in Studio. They don't apply when running tests from Maven in a CI/CD environment. To run coverage reports from Maven, see xref:munit::coverage-maven-concept.adoc[].

== Enable Coverage Reports in Anypoint Studio

To see which flows, and which percentage of event processors in those flows the test covers, click the *Coverage* button:

image::using-munit-coverage-in-anypoint-studio.png["MUnit Coverage tab highlighted in the MUnit section"]

The *Overall coverage* value represents the percentage of Mule application event processors that the MUnit test executes.

Click *Generate Report* to get the report that details the flows and event processors in the Mule configuration files included in the MUnit test.

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
| Column | Description

| *Resource* 
| Name of the Mule configuration file

| *Containers* 
| Number of flows in the Mule configuration file

| *Weight* 
| Percentage of Mule configuration file relative to the entire application. The percentage represents the proportion of event processors within your file compared to the total number of event processors across all configuration files

| *Coverage* 
| Percentage of event processors in the Mule configuration file that the MUnit test executes
|===

Additionally, you can click on each *Resource* to get a more specific and granular report of the Event Processors executed in that resource:

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
| Column              | Description
| *Name*                | Name of the container
| *Type*                | Type of the container
| *Covered Processors* | Processors in the container executed during the MUnit test
| *Processors*         | Total amount of processors in the container
| *Coverage*            | Percentage of the event processors in the container executed in the MUnit test
|===

== Disable Coverage Reports

Disable the coverage calculation from your project run configuration so you test your flow without a coverage report.

Right-click *Package Explorer* and choose *Run As* > *Run Configurations*. Select your MUnit run configuration file to access your suite configuration, and deselect the *Run coverage* option in your coverage settings.

== Exclude XML Files from MUnit Coverage Report

Exclude one or more XML files from an MUnit Coverage report when testing your application. For example, exclude a third-party XML file that doesn't comply with your quality standards to improve your final report score.

. Go to the flow to change.
. Click *Run* > *Run Configuration*.
. Click the name of your project.
. In the *Ignored files* section, click *Add*.

. Type the name of the XML file to exclude from the Coverage report and click *OK*.
. Click *Apply* and *Run*.
