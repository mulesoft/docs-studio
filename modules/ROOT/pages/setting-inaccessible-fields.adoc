Improve your Mule project running on Java 17 or later by configuring the Studio debugger to hide inaccessible fields and methods.

* Hide inaccessible fields: Focus on relevant and accessible data to make the debugging process more efficient. Avoid accessing fields you can't interact with.
* Hide public methods invoked to retrieve inaccessible field values: Maintain the security and integrity of your application by avoiding access to or modification of data through methods not intended for public use.
* Use public methods with assignable return types to retrieve inaccessible field values: Ensure consistency and predictability in data accessibility and manipulation.
