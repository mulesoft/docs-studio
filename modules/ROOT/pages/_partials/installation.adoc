* The `-vm` option and the installation path must be in separate lines.
* The value must be the full absolute or relative path to the Java executable, not just to the Java home directory.
* The `-vm` option must occur after the other Studio-specific options (such as `-product`, `--launcher.*`, etc), but before the `-vmargs` option, because everything after `-vmargs` is passed directly to the JVM.
