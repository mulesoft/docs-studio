Anypoint Studio requires Java 8 to run properly.

To verify that you have the correct JDK version installed, type `java -version` in your command line.

* If you get the error `java: Command not found`, install the JDK 1.8.
* If you get a version different than 1.8, make sure to upgrade, or downgrade to 1.8.

After downloading and installing the JDK, make sure that your JDK installation is properly configured within the the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by following the instructions below.
