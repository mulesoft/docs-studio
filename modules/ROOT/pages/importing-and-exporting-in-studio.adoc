Anypoint Studio supports the ability to import and export your projects or various project elements. The sections that follow outline the procedures to import or export information pertaining to your Studio projects. Because Studio is Eclipse-based, keep in mind that among the import/export options, there are way to import or export projects that are not tailored for Mule projects, and which are not recommended for use.

[CAUTION]
--
If your project is xref:enabling-maven-support-for-a-studio-project.adoc[Mavenized], you should not use this Export feature to get a deployment artifact (i.e: To deploy your application to a Mule Runtime). You can continue to use this feature when you want to export your project so it can be imported into a different workspace. To know how to create your deployment artifact from Studio when using Mavenized projects, please refer to xref:enabling-maven-support-for-a-studio-project.adoc#running-maven-life-cycle-commands[Running Maven Life-Cycle Commands].

|===
|Option |Action
|*Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)* |Import a .zip file containing a new Mule project.
|*Anypoint Studio Project from External Location* |Import a folder and its contents as a new Mule project.
|*Maven-based Mule Project from pom.xml* |Import a .pom file with which Studio can build a new Mule project maintained with Maven.
|*Mule Configuration XML from External Location* |Import a configuration XML file into an existing Mule project.
|===

[NOTE]
When you import a project that was developed in an older version of Studio, the project may require some conversion, which Studio performs automatically. If you import a project developed in Anypoint Studio version 5.1.0 or older into a newer version of Anypoint Studio, then Studio asks you to perform an update to the project so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project. Note that performing this conversion might imply loosing previously defined run configurations.


=== Importing a Mule Deployable Archive

When you export a *Mule Deployable Archive* from an instance of Studio, Studio stores the Studio-specific metadata in the archive so that it can be restored in another instance of Studio. Complete the following steps to import such a file into another instance of Anypoint Studio.

. In the menu, select *Import* from the *File* menu.
. In the *Import* wizard, click to expand the Mule folder, select *Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)*, then click *Next*.
. In the *Zip File* field, click the ellipses (...) button to explore your local drive to find, then select, the Mule Deployable Archive file (that is, the .`zip` file) you wish to import.
. Change the *Project Name*, if you wish, then use the drop-down to select a *Server Runtime* from those you have downloaded locally.
. Click *Finish*. Studio loads the archive file, then displays the project in the Package Explorer under the project name you specified.
