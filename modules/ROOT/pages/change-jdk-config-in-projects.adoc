You can select any of your installed JREs as the default Java runtime environment that Studio uses to run your Mule project.

You can select the version of the JDK to use for the project that is compatible with the Mule runtime version the project runs on.

Learn more about compatible versions of Java at xref:studio-release-notes.adoc[]. 

== Select the Java Version for All Your Studio Projects

. In Studio, click *Anypoint Studio*, and *Preferences*.
. Under *Java*, *Installed JREs*, select the JRE version to use.

** `MacOS X VM` for MacOS.
** `Standard VM` for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
.. Click *Next*.

For example, `Java SE 11`.
.. Click *Finish*.

== Migrate Your Project to a Different Java Version

Studio 7.17.0 and later are compatible with Java 17, so you can upgrade connectors and apps in your projects to obtain its latest features. 

. Right-click in your Studio project.
. Navigate to *Build Path*, and click *Configure Build Path*.
. In the *Libraries* tab, select your *JRE System Library* and click *Edit*.
. Select the *Alternate JRE* option, and select your desired JRE from the drop-down menu.

If you select Java 17 for your project, Studio automatically searches Exchange and suggests xref:update-modules.adoc[the modules and connectors to upgrade] to make your app compatible with Java 17.

If you find issues, you can xref:compatibility-issues-runtime-java.adoc[troubleshoot them] and then xref:deploy-mule-application-task.adoc[deploy your project to the appropriate environment] with Java compatibility checks.
