* Before creating your mapping, configure everything else on the flow so that the input and output is known.

* To filter what you can see from the input or output structures, click the magnifying glass icon image:tips-transform-message-ui-studio-69e11.png[] at the top of either section and then start typing the name of a field.

* Select an element in the output pane to have its corresponding line in the DataWeave code highlighted.

* If an input field is mapped to two or more output fields, you can right-click it and then select which of the multiple outputs you want to highlight in the DataWeave code.
