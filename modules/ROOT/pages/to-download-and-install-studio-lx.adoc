== Prerequisites

* To support the Studio Theme in Linux, have GTK version 3 installed.
* Download the Anypoint Studio installation file from the https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio[Download Site].

== Installation

. Open the extracted Anypoint Studio.
. Click *OK* to accept the default workspace.
** You must Use an absolute path when defining your workspace because Anypoint Studio does not expand the `~` tilde used in Unix and Linux systems.
** If you choose to use an existing workspace, this must have been created using Anypoint Studio 7.0 or later. +
Studio 7.x supports only Mule 4.x projects, because the structure of the project, export format, XML, and scripting language are different than the ones used by Mule 3.x.
