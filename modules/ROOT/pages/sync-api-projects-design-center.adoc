= Synchronize API Specifications with Design Center

Anypoint Studio enables you to import a RAML, OAS 2.0, or OAS 3.0 API specification created in Design Center to an API specification project in Studio so that you can edit it offline and then stage and push your changes as you would do with any version control system (VCS).

This feature only works when importing an API from Design Center as shown in the following process. +
To import an API specification to write a Mule application implementation see xref:import-api-specification-design-center.adoc[Import an API Specification From Design Center].

Your API specification project must have a different name than any other project in your workspace.

[NOTE]
Studio uses the EGit plugin only for the VCS feature of editing API specifications offline. Studio does not support the EGit plugin for Mule application projects that you might track using your own VCS.

== Import an API Specification From Design Center To Edit Locally

. Ensure that no other project in your workspace has the same name as the API project you want to import.
. In the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *Import*.
. Select *Anypoint Studio* > *API Specification from Design Center*.
. In the *Import From Design Center* window, select your Anypoint Platform username and the Anypoint Platform business group where the API specification is located.
+

+
If you are not logged in, click the *Add Account* button to add your Anypoint Platform account. If you have not configured your Anypoint Platform credentials, the username and business group options are unavailable. +
If you want to use a different account, click the *Add Account* button and log in again.
. From the list of available APIs, select the one you want.
+

. Click *Finish*.

Studio imports the API specification as an API specification project so that you can work on your API specification project offline.

== Create Branches

You can create your own branch based on the branch you pulled from Design Center. +
Using a different branch allows you to modify the API definition without risking pushing those changes to the main branch in Design Center.

include::partial$branch-commit-push-changes.adoc[tag=commit-to-branch-vcs]

== Merge Your Changes into the Main Branch

You can merge the changes made in your local branch to the main branch to push to Design Center:
