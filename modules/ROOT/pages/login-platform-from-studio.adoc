Enhance your security in Anypoint Studio by configuring two-factor authentication through xref:access-management::multi-factor-authentication.adoc[Anypoint Platform].

This configuration not only protects your development environment but also ensures that sensitive data remains secure from unauthorized access, providing peace of mind and a robust defense against potential security breaches.
