Anypoint Studio enables you to import a RAML API specification from your local machine and import it either into a new Mule project, or an existing one.

This task only works for RAML types of API specifications.

You can't add a local API specification to an existing Mule project.

. In the taskbar of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for your project.
. Select a Mule runtime engine version.
. In the *API Specification* section, select the *From Design Center or Local Files* tab.
. In the *Location* field, type the location of your local API, or click the *...* button and select *Browse Files*.
You can import either a RAML file or an entire .zip file bundle if your API has schemas and examples.
. Click *Finish*.

Studio scaffolds your API specification. If you choose not to create flows out of your API specification, unselect the *Scaffold Flows From These API Specifications* checkbox.

You can import more than one API. You can select the API you want to scaffold flows and check the *Scaffold selected API specifications* checkbox so that Studio generates the flow based on the imported API.
