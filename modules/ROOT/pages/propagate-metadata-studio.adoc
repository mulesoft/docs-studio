= Propagate Metadata to Other Flows

Studio enables you to propagate your flow's metadata to other flows referenced within your application.

Depending on the metadata configured in your referenced flow, you might need to configure the specific metadata to propagate.

== Propagate Metadata to a Flow Without Custom Metadata

When you add a Flow Reference component to your source flow and reference a target flow with no custom metadata configured, Studio automatically propagates the metadata in your source flow as custom metadata in your target flow.

. In the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for your new project and select *Finish*.
. Drag two flow components to your empty canvas and name them `flow-1` and `flow-2`:
+

. Drag a Set Payload component to `flow-1` and configure the payload:
+
[source,JSON,linenums]
--
{
  "value": {
    "ID": 1,
    "departureDate": "2016/12/20",
    "emptySeats": 200,
    "plane": {
      "type": "Boeing 747",
      "totalSeats": 400
    }
  }
}
--
+
image::set-payload-config.png[]
. Drag a Logger component to `flow-2` and configure it to log `payload`:
+
image::logger-payload-metadata.png[]
. Drag a Flow Reference component to the end of `flow-1` and configure it to reference _`flow-2`_:
+
image::flow-reference-metadata.png[]
. Note that the metadata tab in `flow-2` is now populated with autogenerated metadata, and the input tab in the metadata explorer reflects the payload format that the Set Payload component determines in `flow-1`:

== Propagate Metadata When Extracting an Operation From Your Flow to a New Flow

When you extract an operation from your source flow to propagate to a new target flow or subflow, Studio enables you to configure the metadata that you want to propagate to the newly created flow:

. In the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for your new project and select *Finish*.
. Drag a flow component to your empty canvas and name it `flow-1`.
. Drag a Set Payload component to `flow-1` and configure the payload:
+
[source,JSON,linenums]
--
{
  "value": {
    "ID": 1,
    "departureDate": "2016/12/20",
    "emptySeats": 200,
    "plane": {
      "type": "Boeing 747",
      "totalSeats": 400
    }
  }
}
--
+
image::set-payload-flow-1.png[]
. Drag a Logger component to the end of `flow-1` and configure it to log `#[payload.value.departureDate]`:
+
image::logger-metadata-case-2.png[]
. Right-click your Logger component and select *Extract To...* > *Flow*:
+
image::extract-operation-metadata.png[]
. Name your target flow `flow-2`.
. Select *Metadata Preferences* to configure the input and output metadata. +
Note that Studio automatically recognizes the metadata of your flow.
+
image::extract-flow-metadata.png[]
. Select *OK*.
. Your Logger component is now in `flow-2`, the metadata tab is populated with autogenerated metadata, and the input tab in the metadata explorer reflects the payload format that the Set Payload component configures in `flow-1`:
+

== Propagate Metadata to a Flow with Custom Metadata Already Configured

When you add a Flow Reference component to your source flow and reference another, target flow that has custom metadata already configured, Studio prompts you to select the metadata that you want to propagate:

. In the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for your new project and select *Finish*.
. Drag two flow components to your empty canvas and name them `flow-1` and `flow-2`:
+
image::both-flows-metadata.png[]
. Drag a Set Payload component to `flow-1` and configure the payload:
+
[source,JSON,linenums]
--
{
  "value": {
    "ID": 1,
    "departureDate": "2016/12/20",
    "emptySeats": 200,
    "plane": {
      "type": "Boeing 747",
      "totalSeats": 400
    }
  }
}
--
+
image::set-payload-config.png[]
. Create a JSON file with the name _`arrival-type-example.json`_ in your `src/main/resources/examples` directory with the following format:
+
.arrival-type-example.json
[source,JSON,linenums]
--
{
  "value": {
    "ID": 1,
    "arrivalDate": "2016/12/20",
    "plane": {
      "type": "Boeing 747",
      "totalSeats": 400
    }
  }
}
--
. Select `flow-2` > *Metadata* tab > *Add Metadata*:
+
image::add-metadata-flow-2.png[]
. Select *Input: Payload* > *Edit*:
+
image::configure-input-metadata.png[]
.  Select *Add*, create a new metadata type called _`arrivalType`_, and select *Create type*:
+
image::create-metadata-type.png[]
. Select the type *JSON* > *Example* and select the *...* button to browse to `src/main/resources/examples/arrival-type-example.json`:
+
image::create-json-metadata-type.png[]
. Click *Select*.
. Drag a Logger component to `flow-2` and configure it to log `payload`:
+
image::logger-payload-metadata.png[]
. Drag a Flow Reference component to the end of `flow-1` and configure it to reference _`flow-2`_:
+
image::flow-reference-metadata.png[]
. Select the Flow Reference component *Metadata* tab, and select *Set Metadata*:
+
image::set-metadata-example.png[]
+
Studio warns you that setting the metadata from `flow-1` will overwrite the existing `arrivalType` metadata type configured for `flow-2`:
+
image::overwrite-metadata.png[]
. Select *Customize* to configure the desired metadata to propagate to the flow.
+
Note that Studio recognizes the actual metadata as that set in `flow-1`, and the expected metadata as that configured in `flow-2`.
+
image::custom-metadata-configure-overwrite.png[]
+
Customizing the actual and expected metadata for a referenced flow is helpful if you want to define a specific set of metadata to propagate.
