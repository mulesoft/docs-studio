Anypoint Studio debugger enables you to run your application from Studio in debug mode, and to configure breakpoints to stop the execution of your application at a specific message processor. Then, using the *Mule Debugger* view, you can inspect the content of the message as it exists at that point in the flow, and evaluate a DataWeave expression against it.

The debugger works with Enterprise Edition runtimes and does not connect to Community Edition runtimes.

When you run your application in debug mode for the first time, Anypoint Studio prompts you to load the *Mule debug* perspective. The *Mule debug* perspective consists of a list of preconfigured views that help you debug your application:

* *Mule Debugger*
* *Evaluate DataWeave Expressions*
* *Mule Breakpoints*

== Debug Your Project in Studio

To debug your application in Studio:

. Right-click your project in the *Package Explorer* view.
. Select *Debug As* > *Mule Application*. +
Studio asks you for permission to switch to the *Mule debug* perspective.
. Click *Yes*.

Additionally, you can run your application in debug mode by right-clicking in the canvas and selecting *Debug Project*, or by clicking the *Debug* button on your top toolbar image:to-run-debug-mode-e7b7b.png[debug-button].

== Configure Studio Debugger

When debugging in Studio, the debugger listens for incoming TCP connections on `localhost` and port `6666`. You can modify this configuration in by clicking *Run* > *Debug configurations* and selecting the *Debug* tab.
