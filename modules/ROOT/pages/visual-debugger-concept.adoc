With Anypoint Studio debugger, you can run your application from Studio in debug mode and configure breakpoints to stop application execution at a specific message processor. In the *Mule Debugger* view, inspect the content of the message as it exists at that point in the flow and evaluate a DataWeave expression against it.

The debugger works with Enterprise Edition runtimes and doesn't connect to Mule Kernel runtimes.

When you run your application in debug mode for the first time, Anypoint Studio prompts you to load the *Mule debug* perspective. The *Mule debug* perspective is a list of views that help you debug your application:

* *Mule Debugger*
* *Evaluate DataWeave Expressions*
* *Mule Breakpoints*

== Debug Your Project in Studio

To debug your application in Studio:

. Right-click your project in *Package Explorer*.
. Select *Debug As* > *Mule Application*.
+
Studio requests permission to switch to the *Mule debug* perspective.
. Click *Yes*.

Alternatively, run your application in debug mode by right-clicking in the canvas and selecting *Debug Project*, or by clicking image:to-run-debug-mode-e7b7b.png[""] (*Debug*) on the toolbar.

== Configure Studio Debugger

Enable precise control over application debugging by setting the debugger connections and maximum values. To modify the default configuration values, click *Run* > *Debug configurations* and select the *Debug* tab.

| Debugger Maximum Payload Collection Size 
| Determine the maximum size of the payload data that the debugger collects and displays during a debugging session. Manage the memory usage of the debugger to ensure it doesn't consume excessive system resources to avoid performance degradation or crashes, especially when dealing with large data payloads.
