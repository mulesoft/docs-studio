= Create an API Specification Project in Studio

Studio enables you to create a RAML API specification, an OAS 2.0 or 3.0 API specification, or an API fragment, and automatically sync it with Design Center.

[NOTE]
Studio uses the EGit plugin for the VCS feature of editing API specifications offline. Studio doesn't support the EGit plugin for Mule application projects that you track using your own VCS.

To start creating an API specification project in Studio, log in to Anypoint Platform. See xref:set-credentials-in-studio-to.adoc[Configure Platform Credentials].

. In the taskbar of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *New* > *API Specification Project*.
. Select the tab of type of API specification project to create:
* Create a new API specification by selecting the *New API Specification* tab and the type of API.
+

* To create a new API fragment, select the *New API Fragment* tab, and then select the type of API fragment.
+
image::create-api-fragment.png["The New API Fragment tab and file type drop-down menu highlighted in the New API Specification window."]
. Type a name for your project.
. Select *Finish*.

Studio prompts you to switch to the API design perspective.

In the API design perspective, use the API editor to write your API specification or API fragment. Additionally, you can use the API Console view to mock a live service so you can test your API specification.

Studio uses VCS to track the development of your API specification project and keep it synchronized with Design Center.

== Create Branches

Using a different branch enables you to use a modified API definition in certain cases, without modifying the main branch in Design Center.

== Merge and Push Your API Specification Project

Merge the changes made to your API specification to your main branch and sync it with Design Center.
