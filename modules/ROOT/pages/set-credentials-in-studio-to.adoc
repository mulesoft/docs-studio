Add your Anypoint Platform user account to enable Anypoint Studio to access resources in your organization. You can add as many Anypoint Platform user accounts as you need.

To add your account, you must configure your Anypoint Platform user account credentials:

. In the top menu bar, navigate to *Anypoint Studio* > *Preferences*.

. Enter your username and password for your Anypoint Platform user, and select *Sign in*.
. Select *Apply and close*.

When adding a new credential for the first time, Studio notifies you that a new master password has been created. Additionally, Studio prompts you to create two recovery questions to use in case you forget your master password. +
See xref:secure-storage.adoc[] for more information.

[TIP]

In every operation related to the platform, you see a toolbar that enables you to change accounts and/or business groups, if applicable. You can also add more accounts from this toolbar.

For example, you can add or change user accounts when selecting *Search in Exchange* from the Mule Palette view:
