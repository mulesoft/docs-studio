. Enter your username and password for your Anypoint Platform user, and select *Sign in*.
. Select *Apply and close*.

When adding a new credential for the first time, Studio notifies you that a new master password has been created. Additionally, Studio prompts you to create two recovery questions to use in case you forget your master password. +
See xref:secure-storage.adoc[] for more information.

[TIP]
--
In every operation related to the Platform, you see a toolbar that allows you to change accounts and/or business groups, if applicable. You can also add more accounts from this toolbar.

For example, you can add or change user accounts when selecting *Search in Exchange* from the Mule Palette view:
