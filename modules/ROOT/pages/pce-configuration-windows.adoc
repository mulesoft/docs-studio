. Open your browser and navigate to your PCE instance URL.
. Your browser displays a *Your connection is not private* error.
. Click the *Not secure* section in your URL bar, and select *Certificate*.

. Add your `.cer` file certificate to your Studio embedded Java cacerts keystore:
+
[source]
--
bin\keytool -importcert ^
-keystore [cacerts_path] ^ //<1>
-storepass [pass] ^ //<2>
-alias [alias] ^ //<3>
-file [certificate_name].cer //<4>
--
+
<1> `cacerts_path` is your Anypoint Studio artifact. +
For example:
** Java 11: `AnypointStudio\plugins\org.mule.tooling.jdk.win32.x86_64_1.1.5\lib\security\cacerts`.
** Java 8: `AnypointStudio\plugins\org.mule.tooling.jdk.v8.win32.x86_64_1.1.5\jre\lib\security\cacerts`.
<2> `pass` is your cacerts keys store password. +
Java default cacerts password is `changeit`.
<3> `alias` is the name your certificate gets when you save it in the keystore.
<4> `certificate_name` is the path to the .cer file generated and saved in the previous step.
. In Studio, open the preferences view. +
Navigate to *Window* > *Preferences...*.
. Type the URL of your PCE installation in the *Private Cloud Instance URL* field.

== Configure your PCE User Login

The first time you configure your user's login, Studio asks you to confirm your PCE certificate:

Navigate to *Anypoint Studio* > *Preferences...*.
