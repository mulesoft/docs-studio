By default, the DataWeave code from a Transform Message component is expressed inline within your Mule XML file. You can instead keep each in a separate file ( `.dwl` ) and have your XML reference them. These files are packaged with your Mule application when built.

To export the DataWeave code to a `.dwl` file:


* click the *Edit Current Target* button
+

* Select the 'File' radio button

+
image::dataweave-externalfile2.png["A dialog box prompts the user to select a target, with options to input a file and choose between inline or file source code"]

* Type a name for your `.dwl` file
* Click OK

A file is created under the `src/main/resources` folder in your project containing your DataWeave code.
