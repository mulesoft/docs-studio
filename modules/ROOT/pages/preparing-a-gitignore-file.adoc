[NOTE]
This page describes a feature that is currently available using *Mule Studio (December 2013)* or newer.  Download and launch the https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[latest version of Anypoint Studio] to take advantage of this feature.

As a part of a team of developers, you may be using a source code management (SCM) tool such as **https://git-scm.com/[git] **to keep track of changes in an application. Studio supports the use of git by presenting an option to prepare a standard ` gitignore ` file for a new Mule Project.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes familiarity with https://git-scm.com/[git] as a software version control system, and that you are using xref:index.adoc[Anypoint Studio] to build a new application that you intend to manage using git.

== Configuring a gitignore File

A project's ` gitignore ` file contains a list of files and folders that git should ignore when tracking a project. Because all Studio projects contain a set of files that git should _not_ include in its version control, you can create a `gitignore` file when creating a new Mule Project in Studio.

. Create a new Mule Project (*File* > *New* > *Mule Project*).
. In the first pane of the *New Mule Project* wizard (see image below), check **Create a default .gitignore file:**

image::mujeproject.png["A dialog box with settings to create a Mule project, including the option to create a default gitignore file"]

. Click *Finish* to save and open your new project.

[NOTE]
Studio stores the *`gitignore` file* as a hidden file in the project's root directory. To view the contents of the file, change the settings of your operating system to display hidden files.

== gitignore File Contents

A `gitignore` file generally includes several files and folders that are commonly part of Java and Eclipse projects. A `gitignore` file prepared in Studio contains a few more Studio-specific elements (see table below).
