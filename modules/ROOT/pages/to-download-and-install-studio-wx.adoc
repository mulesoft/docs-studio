== Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the Java SE JDK 8 installed and configured.
* Download the Anypoint Studio installation file from the https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio[Download Site].


After downloading and installing the JDK, ensure that your JDK installation is properly configured within the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

. In Search, search for `System (Control Panel)` and select it.
. Click *Advanced System Settings*.
. Click *Environment Variables*.
. In *System Variables*, look for the PATH environment variable:
** If `PATH` is visible, select it and click *Edit* to navigate to *Edit System Variable*.
** If `PATH` is not visible, click *New* to navigate to *New System Variable*.
. Ensure that the `/bin` directory of your JDK 1.8.0 installation is the first item in your `PATH` environment variable.
. Click *OK*.

== Installation

. Extract the Windows installation file into the `C:\` root folder.
** If you are using a Windows antivirus application, ensure that the `plugins/` and `features/` directories are under the _trusted_ category.
. Open the extracted Anypoint Studio.
. Click OK to accept the default workspace. +
** If you choose to use an existing workspace, this must have been created using Anypoint Studio 7.0 or later. +
Studio 7.x supports only Mule 4.x projects, because the structure of the project, export format, XML, and scripting language are different than the ones used by Mule 3.x.

== Troubleshooting

If Anypoint Studio fails to load with a *An Error Has Occured* message, you must configure it to point to your JDK installation as the default VM:

. Locate your `AnypointStudio.ini` file inside your Anypoint Studio installation directory.
. Add the `-vm` option to point to your specific JDK installation path.

-vm
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_73\bin\javaw.exe
----
+
* The `-vm` option and the installation path must be on separate lines.
* The value must be the full absolute or relative path to the Java executable, not just to the Java home directory.
* The `-vm` option must occur after the other Studio-specific options (such as `-product`, `--launcher.*`, etc), but before the `-vmargs` option.
+
If you encounter *Java was started but returned exit code=1* while starting Anypoint Studio, modify the `-vm` argument to point to the `jvm.dll`:
