== Exclude Studio from Windows Defender Scans

While Windows Defender is a tool for keeping your computer safe, it can slow down the performance of Studio because it scans files in real-time as they are accessed, which causes delays. To prevent performance issues, you can completely exclude Studio from Windows Defender real-time protection:

. Run Studio. 
+
A Windows Defender real-time protection notice asks whether to exclude Studio folders and processes:

+
* The `/.p2` folder stores Studio plugins.
+
* The second folder shows the path of the workspace that you select when launching Studio.
+
* The third folder points to the Anypoint Studio application location.
+
. Optionally, select the *Remember my decision* checkbox.
. Click *Yes*.
. Click *Yes* again when Windows PowerShell requests permission to make the change:

NOTE: If you select the *Remember my decision* checkbox and click *No*, Windows Defender real-time protection scans Studio folders and processes as you work with them.
