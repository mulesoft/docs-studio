Anypoint Studio comes bundled with a default browser to display elements of the Anypoint Platform UI. For example, when you deploy to CloudHub from Studio, the Runtime Manager UI displayed in Studio is rendered using a built-in browser.

This built-in browser is the default. However, if you log in to Anypoint Platform using multi-factor authentication (MFA), you must configure Studio to use your system's native browser to render the Anypoint Platform UI:

. Navigate to *Preferences* > *Anypoint Studio* > *Browser*.
. Select the type of default browser for Studio:
+

<1> *Built-in*: Uses the built-in browser.
<2> *Native*: Uses the native browser of your operative system.
. Click *Preview* to verify the changed configuration. +

Additionally, if you use Windows you must perform an additional configuration:

. Quit Anypoint Studio if you are running it.
. Download the latest fixed version of WebView2 from the https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/[Microsoft Developer Portal^].
. Locate your `AnypointStudio.ini` file inside your Anypoint Studio's installation directory.
. Add the following lines to the `AnypointStudio.ini` file:
