Anypoint Studio comes bundled with a default browser to display elements of the Anypoint Platform UI. For example, when you deploy to CloudHub from Studio, the Runtime Manager UI displayed in Studio is rendered using a built-in browser.

This built-in browser is the default. However, if it fails to display, you can configure Studio to use your system's native browser to render the Anypoint Platform UI:

. Navigate to *Preferences* > *Anypoint Studio* > *Browser*.
. Select the type of default browser for Studio:
+

<1> *Built-in*: Uses the built-in browser. This is the recommended setting.
<2> *Native*: Uses the native browser of your operative system.
. Click *Preview* to verify the changed configuration. +
