When you import an API specification as a dependency, you can update the API specification version in your Studio project.


To update the API specification:

. In the Package Explorer view, right-click the Mule project that contains the API specification you want to update.
. Select *API Specs* > the name of your API > *Update Version*.
+
After you update the specification, Studio asks you if you want to regenerate the flows based on the new version.
+
To manually generate a flow for the updated API, right-click the Mule project where you updated the API specification, and select *API Specs* > the name of your API > *Generate Flows*.

Additionally, you can manage the API specifications in your project that are linked to Exchange from the API specification project management view. To do so, click the *Manage Mule Project APIs* icon (image:manage-project-api-icon.png[2%,2%]) in the top task bar.
