= Edit Your API Specification Project Exchange File

Anypoint Studio enables you to edit the `exchange.json` file of your API specification project. The `exchange.json` file contains metadata required by Anypoint Exchange to describe your API asset.

To edit your `exchange.json` file:

. Select it from your API specification project in your Project Explorer view:

[calloutlist]
. You cannot edit the first item, *Name*, because this is the artifact name of your API specification asset.
. Use the second item, *Main file*, to choose the main file of your API specification asset.
. You cannot edit the third item, *Artifact ID*, because this is the artifact ID of your API specification asset.
. You cannot edit the fourth item, *Group ID*, because this is the group ID of your API specification asset.
. Use the fifth item, *Asset Version*, to update your API specification asset version.
. Use the sixth item, *API Version*, to update the API version of your API specification asset.
. Use the green plus icon to add a new dependency to your API specification asset.

Additionally, you can edit the XML of your `exchange.json` file by selecting the editor's *exchange.json* tab:
