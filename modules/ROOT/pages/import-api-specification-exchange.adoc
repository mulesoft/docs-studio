Anypoint Studio enables you to import a RAML or OAS 2.0 API specification into either a new Mule project or an existing one.

If you are using Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4.1.3 and earlier, or if you prefer to import an API specification that's not in Exchange, follow the steps presented in xref:import-api-specification-local-file.adoc[import an API specification from a local file] or xref:import-api-specification-design-center.adoc[import an API specification from Design Center] depending on your preferred use case.

If you cannot access Exchange from your work environment, you can still import an API specification from your local Maven installation
