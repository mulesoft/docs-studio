Import an AsyncAPI, OAS, or RAML API spec into a new or existing Mule project.

If you're using Mule runtime engine (Mule) 4.1.3 and earlier, or if you prefer to import an API specification that isn't available in Exchange, you can xref:import-api-specification-local-file.adoc[] or xref:import-api-specification-design-center.adoc[].

If you can't access Exchange from your work environment, you can import an API specification from your local Maven installation.
