*Anypoint Studio* comes bundled with an embedded Enterprise runtime with a 30-day Enterprise trial license. You can install newer or earlier versions of the Mule runtime, whether Enterprise or Community versions.

. In Studio, under the *Help* menu, select *Install New Software.*
. In the *Work With* field of the *Install* wizard, use the drop-down menu to select the update site for Mule.

If Studio does not show a list of update sites from the drop-down menu, you need to add this update site manually:
+
.. Click the *Add...* button next to the drop-down menu.
.. In *Name*, add a name for this update site. For example: `Mule ESB Runtimes`.
.. In *Location*, add the Mule runtimes update site: `+http://studio.mulesoft.org/r3/studio-runtimes/+`
. Check the box to select Community or Enterprise and click *Next*.
. Select one or more runtimes you want to install. If you only want one version, expand the item and click the version you want. After selecting one or more versions, click *Next*.

. Click to agree to the terms and conditions of the license agreement, and click *Finish*. Studio installs the runtime(s). This may take several minutes to complete depending on the speed of your Internet connection and the number of runtimes you select.
. Click to agree to restart Anypoint Studio.
. When Studio restarts, see the available runtimes under the File menu, select *New* > *Mule Project.*

== Change the Runtime of an Existing Project

. Complete the procedure above to install additional Mule runtimes on your instance of Studio.

. Use the drop-down menu next to *Server Runtime* to select a new Mule runtime.
