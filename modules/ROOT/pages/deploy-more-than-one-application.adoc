Anypoint Studio allows you to deploy more than one application into the same Mule instance through xref:3.9@mule-runtime::application-deployment.adoc#deploying-applications-in-parallel[parallel deployment].

== Deploying more than one application simultaneously.

To deploy more than one application into the same Mule Runtime instance:

. Make sure all the Mule projects you want to deploy are open and visible in your Package Explorer.
+
[NOTE]
--
For this example, we are deploying `MuleApp1` and `MuleApp2` simultaneously.
--
+
. Go to *Run* and select *Run Configurations...*.
.. From the left navigation bar, select one of the Mule applications you want to deploy.
.. Under the _Mule domains/projects to launch_ select all the applications you want to deploy.

[CAUTION]
--
If the Mule application is not an open project in Studio, you won't be able to select it.
--
+
.. Select *Apply*.
.. Click *OK* to finish.
. After Studio finishes deploying your project, you should see a notification in the console showing all select applications deployed
