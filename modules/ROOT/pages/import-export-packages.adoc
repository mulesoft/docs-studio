Anypoint Studio supports the ability to import and export your projects or various project elements. +
This document outlines the procedures to import or export information pertaining to your Studio projects.

Because Studio is Eclipse-based, keep in mind that among the import/export options, there are ways to import or export projects that are not tailored for Mule projects and that are not recommended for use.

== Importing Projects To Studio

Studio presents two importing options.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
|Option |Action
|*Packaged Mule Application (.jar)* |Imports a `.jar` file containing a new Mule project.
|*Anypoint Studio Project from File System* |Imports a folder and its contents as a new Mule project.
|===

=== Importing a Mule Application (Deployable Archive)

. Select *Import* from the *File* menu.
. In the Import wizard, click to expand the Mule folder, and select *Packaged Mule Application (.jar)*, then click Next.
. In the *File* field, click the ellipses (...) button to explore your local drive. Then select the Mule Deployable Archive file (that is, the `.jar` file) you want to import. +
If you want, you can change project's name.
. Click *Finish*.

[NOTE]
When you import a project that was developed in Studio 7.1.x or older versions of Studio 7, Studio will prompt you to *Update your Workspace*. +
See xref:update-workspace.adoc[Updating Workspaces] for more details.

=== Importing a Mule Application (Project From File System)

. Select *Import* from the *File* menu.
. In the Import wizard, click to expand the Mule folder, and select *Anypoint Studio Project from File System*, then click Next.
. In the *Project Root* field, click the ellipses (...) button to explore your local drive, and select the root folder for the Mule project that you want to import. +
If you want, you can change the project's name and choose a different runtime version in which to run it.
+
[NOTE]
You can choose a different runtime version if you have other embedded runtime versions installed in Studio. +
See _Mule Runtimes for Anypoint Studio Update Site_ in xref:studio-update-sites.adoc[About Anypoint Studio Update Sites] to learn how to install other versions of the runtime in Studio.

== Exporting Projects From Studio

Studio lets you package and export your project as a Mule deployable file.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
|Option |Action
|*Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)* |Exports a Mule project to a `.jar` deployable file.
|===

=== Exporting a Studio Project to a Mule Deployable File

. Select *Export* from the *File* menu.
. In the Import wizard, click to expand the Mule folder, and select *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*, then click Next.
. Select the project that you want to export, and click *Next*.
. In the *JAR file* drop-down menu, click the ellipses (...) button to explore your local drive, and select the folder to which you want to export your JAR deployable file. +
Additionally, you can choose *Attach Project Sources* to include metadata that Studio requires to re-import the deployable file as an open Mule project into your workspace. +
This is the same as using the `-DattachMuleSources` flag when packaging using the Mule Maven Plugin. See xref:4.1@mule4-runtime::package-task-mmp.adoc[To Package a Mule Application (Mule Maven Plugin)] for more information.
+
You can also choose *Include Project Modules and Dependencies*. +
This option creates a heavy package with all the dependencies of your project already packaged in your app. This is required to deploy your app to CloudHub. +
If you uncheck this option, Studio exports your project in a lightweight package. This is useful if you want to distribute your project to other Studio installations because it only keeps a reference to all its dependencies. When re-importing it to Studio, all your dependencies will be automatically downloaded.
