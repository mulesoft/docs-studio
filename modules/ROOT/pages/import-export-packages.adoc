Anypoint Studio supports the ability to import and export your projects or various project elements. +
This document outlines the procedures to import or export information pertaining to your Studio projects.

Because Studio is Eclipse-based, keep in mind that among the import/export options, there are ways to import or export projects that are not tailored for Mule projects and that are not recommended for use.

== Importing Projects To Studio

Studio presents two importing options.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
|Option |Action
|*Packaged Mule Application (.jar)* |Imports a `.jar` file containing a new Mule project.
|*Anypoint Studio Project from File System* |Imports a folder and its contents as a new Mule project.
|===

=== Importing a Mule Application (Deployable Archive)

. Select *Import* from the *File* menu.
. In the Import wizard, click to expand the Mule folder, select *Packaged Mule Application (.jar)*, and click *Next*.
. In the *File* field, click the ellipses (...) button to explore your local drive. Then select the Mule Deployable Archive file (that is, the `.jar` file) you want to import. +
If you want, you can change project's name.
. Click *Finish*.

[NOTE]
When you import a project that was developed in Studio 7.1.x or older versions of Studio 7, Studio will prompt you to *Update your Workspace*. +
See xref:update-workspace.adoc[Updating Workspaces] for more details.

=== Importing a Mule Application (Project From File System)

. Select *Import* from the *File* menu.
. In the Import wizard, click to expand the Mule folder, select *Anypoint Studio Project from File System*, and click *Next*.
. In the *Project Root* field, click the ellipses (...) button to explore your local drive, and select the root folder for the Mule project that you want to import. +
If you want, you can change the project's name and choose a different runtime version in which to run it.
+
[NOTE]
You can choose a different runtime version if you have other embedded runtime versions installed in Studio. +
See _Mule Runtimes for Anypoint Studio Update Site_ in xref:studio-update-sites.adoc[About Anypoint Studio Update Sites] to learn how to install other versions of the runtime in Studio.

== Exporting Projects From Studio

Studio lets you package and export your project as a Mule deployable file.

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
|Option |Action
|*Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)* |Exports a Mule project to a `.jar` deployable file.
|===

=== Exporting a Studio Project to a Deployable Mule Application

. Select *Export* from the *File* menu.
. In the Import wizard, click to expand the Mule folder, select *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*, and click *Next*.
. Select the project that you want to export and click *Next*.
. In the *JAR file* menu, click the ellipses (...) button to explore your local drive, and select the folder to which you want to export your deployable JAR file. +
Additionally, you can choose *Attach Project Sources* to include metadata that Studio requires to reimport the deployable file as an open Mule project into your workspace.
+
You must keep the *Attach Project Sources* option selected to be able to import the packaged JAR file back into a Studio workspace. This is the same as using the `-DattachMuleSources` flag when packaging using the Mule Maven Plugin. See xref:mule-runtime::mmp-concept.adoc#create-an-application-package-to-import-into-anypoint-studio[Create an Application Package to Import into Anypoint Studio] in the Mule Maven Plugin documentation for more information.

=== Exporting a Studio Project to a Shareable Lightweight Package

. Select *Export* from the *File* menu.
. In the Import wizard, click to expand the Mule folder, select *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*, and click *Next*.
. Select the project that you want to export and click *Next*.
. In the *JAR file* menu, click the ellipses (...) button to explore your local drive, and select the folder to which you want to export your JAR deployable file.
. Deselect the *Include project modules and dependencies* option.  +
This option skips bundling the actual modules and external dependencies required to run the Mule application in a Mule runtime engine, creating a lightweight JAR file package that does not include any dependencies specified in the Mule application's `pom.xml` file.
+
The generated JAR file is not a functional deployable archive and cannot be deployed to a Mule runtime engine, but instead offers a way to archive only the source files that make up the Mule application. This is the same as using the `-lightWeightPackage` flag when packaging using the Mule Maven Plugin and is useful if you want to distribute your project to other Studio installations because it only keeps a reference to all its dependencies. When you import a lightweight package into Studio, all your dependencies are automatically downloaded. See xref:mule-runtime::mmp-concept.adoc#create-a-lightweight-package[Create a Lightweight Package] in the Mule Maven Plugin documentation for more information.
