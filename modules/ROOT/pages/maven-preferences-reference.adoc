In Studio, you can personalize your preferences when working with Maven. Studio reads the `settings.xml` file, which details the configurations Maven uses during its operation. The `settings.xml` file enables you to tailor the behavior of the build process for all the projects on your system. With the `settings.xml` file, you can configure:

* Dependency and plugin repositories
* Proxy servers
* Authentication
* Plugins

See https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Maven setting references^] for additional information. 

To configure Maven setting preferences, go to *Anypoint Studio > Settings…* and click *Maven*.

See https://docs.mulesoft.com/studio/latest/maven-preferences-reference[Maven Reference] for additional information about configuring MuleSoft repositories.

== Configure Global Settings

Studio manages the servers used in the global settings and you can configure Studio to use an external Maven installation. By doing so, Studio automatically detects and populates the IDs from the `settings.xml` file stored in `${maven.installation.home}/conf/settings.xml`.

. Select *Override global settings path*.
. Click *Browse*.
. Select your *settings.xml* file and click *Open*.
+ The IDs are listed.
. Click *Apply and Close*.
