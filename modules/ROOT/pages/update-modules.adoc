= Update Your Modules

Every time Studio starts, it checks for updated modules in your open projects. You can update to the latest minor version of your module or upgrade directly to the latest version available. Upgrading to a major version of a module can introduce compatibility issues in your project. Review the release notes for your modules before upgrading to a major version.

NOTE: If you xref:change-jdk-config-in-projects.adoc[select Java 17 for your project], Studio automatically searches Exchange and suggests the modules and connectors to upgrade to make your app compatible with Java 17.

To manually check for module updates:

. Ensure that you are logged in to Anypoint Platform.
. In the menu bar, click *Manage Mule Modules* (image:manage-mule-modules-icon.png["Mule icon" 2%,2%]).
+
image::manage-mule-modules-location.png["A Mule Palette screenshot with a prompt to open a Mule Configuration file or test to view the palette"]

NOTE: This feature does not support modules that are inherited from a parent POM file.

You can also manage all dependencies in your project:

. In the menu bar, click *Manage dependencies* image:manage-dependencies.png[A stylized letter i in a house shape" 2%,2%].
. Under *Mule Project*, select *Modules*.
+
image::manage-modules.png["Table of modules, their names, versions, and package names, with an arrow pointing to "Modules""]
+
When Studio loads this wizard for the first time, it automatically checks for new versions of your modules.
. Select the module that you want to update and click *Update version*.
+
image::update-module-version.png["A dialog box will display a list of modules and their respective versions, allowing for selective updates"]
+
Additionally, you can select *Update all dependencies to latest* to update all dependencies to the latest version of each.
+
image::update-all-modules.png["A dialog box displays the available modules with their version numbers and provides options to update, restore, apply, or close"]
. Select *Apply and close*.

Studio updates your selected dependencies.

This process works if you manage your dependencies using Studio. 

To use Maven properties to specify your module version:

[source,XML,linenums]
--
<properties>
  <http_connector_version>1.5.23</http_connector_version>
</properties>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.connectors</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-http-connector</artifactId>
    <version>${http_connector_version}</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
--

Contact your development team to update your custom Maven code to the latest version available.
