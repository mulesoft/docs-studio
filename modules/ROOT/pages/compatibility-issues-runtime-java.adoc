The modules in your project can have compatibility issues with Java or Mule runtime.

Mule runtime 4.6 is compatible with Java 17, and Mule runtime 4.5 and earlier are compatible with Java 8 and 11.

When you create a project, Studio uses its default JRE. And when you select a module, Studio displays the latest version of the modules compatible with your JRE and your Mule runtime.

If you select a different JRE for your project and you don't update your module to a compatible version, your project fails at deployment.

To avoid deployment errors, you must xref:change-jdk-config-in-projects.adoc[select a JRE] that is compatible with your current Studio Mule runtime. If needed, xref:update-modules.adoc[update your modules] to select a compatible version.
