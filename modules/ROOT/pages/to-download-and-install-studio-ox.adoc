= Downloading and Installing Anypoint Studio (OS X)
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

== Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the Java SE JDK 8 installed and configured.
* Download the Anypoint Studio installation file from the https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio[Download Site].

== Installation

. Extract the Anypoint Studio package and move it to your `/Applications` directory.
. Open the extracted Anypoint Studio.
. Click OK to accept the default workspace. +
** You must Use an absolute path when defining your workspace because Anypoint Studio does not expand the `~` tilde used in Unix and Linux systems.
** If you choose to use an existing workspace, this must have been created using Anypoint Studio 7.0 or later. +
Studio 7.x supports only Mule 4.x projects, because the structure of the project, export format, XML, and scripting language are different than the ones used by Mule 3.x.

== Troubleshooting

If Anypoint Studio fails to load with a *An Error Has Occurred* message, you must configure it to point to your JDK installation as the default VM:

. Go to your `/Applications` folder, right click the `AnypointStudio` package and select *Show Package Contents*.
. Go to `Contents` > `Eclipse`, and open the `AnypointStudio.ini` file.
. Add the -vm option to point to your specific JDK installation path.

* The `-vm` option and the installation path must be on separate lines.
* The value must be the full absolute or relative path to the Java executable, not just to the Java home directory.
* The `-vm` option must occur after the other Studio-specific options (such as `-product`, `--launcher.*`, etc), but before the `-vmargs` option.
