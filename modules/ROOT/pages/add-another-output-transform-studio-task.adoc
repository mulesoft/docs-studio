A single Transform Message component can give shape to several different parts of the output (example: the payload, a flow variable, a property). Each different output part must be defined in a separate DataWeave code, written out in a separate tab of the Transform pane. For example: if one tab defines the payload, and another an outbound property, these are both parts of the same output Mule message.



To add a new output:


. Click the *Add new target* button image:using-dataweave-in-studio-34a3e.png[].


. Specify where in the output Mule message to place the result of this new DataWeave transform. In case you're creating a new variable or property, you must also set a name for it.

[NOTE]
Execution order of multiple outputs may vary. Ensure each transformation is independent of the order of execution and the other outputs.
