= Add Another Output to the Transform Message Component

:page-aliases: 6.5.x@studio::add-another-output-transform-studio-task.adoc

A single Transform Message component can shape different output parts, such as the payload, a flow variable, or a property. You must define each output part in a separate DataWeave code, written out in a separate tab of the Transform pane. For example: if one tab defines the payload, and another an outbound property, both are parts of the same output Mule message.

To add a new output:

. Click the *Add new target* button image:using-dataweave-in-studio-34a3e.png["Add new target icon"].

. Specify where in the output Mule message to place the result of this new DataWeave transform. In case you're creating a new variable or property, you must also set a name for it.

[NOTE]
Execution order of multiple outputs can vary. Ensure each transformation is independent of the order of execution and the other outputs.
