Anypoint Studio enables you to import API specifications into either a new Mule project or an existing one.

If you choose to implement your API specifications as Exchange or Maven dependencies of your project, you can either import your RAML or OAS 2.0 specifications xref:import-api-specification-exchange.adoc[from Exchange] or xref:import-api-specification-maven.adoc[Maven].

If you choose to implement your API specifications as standalone attachments to your project you can import a RAML specification from either xref:import-api-specification-local-file.adoc[your local hard drive] or from xref:import-api-specification-design-center.adoc[Anypoint Design Center].

See xref:api-development-studio.adoc[API development in Studio] for more information about these two different approaches.
